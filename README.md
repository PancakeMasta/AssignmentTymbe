# AssignemntTymbe

This is a solution for frontend assignment presented by Tymbe, Ltd.
The task was to create a responsive website page based on provided mockup
using Bootstrap v4.x.

Fonts used in the project are as close to the mockup as they can be. Since some of them have to be paid for,
similar free fonts were used.

Mockup for mobile was not presented, so I had a free will. Thus I decided not to display some of the images,
as they did not fit with the text. Navigation bars on top and bottom of the page were made collapsible.

Mockup also provided a "Messenger button" at the bottom of the page, which was not implemented, as I lack the
backend implementation of this feature.

If anything is not acording to requirements, feel free to let me know, so I can change it to your liking.

Page was created using VS code IDE.

Used technologies:  Bootstrap v4.5.2,
                    jQuery.js,
                    popper.js,
                    font-awesome.css (for icons in the navigation bars).

Contents:   css/                - folder with .css style file,
            fonts/              - folder with offline fonts used in the website,
            img/                - image files used in the webiste,
            index.html          - HTML source code of the page,
